# Fake News Detector (Python + NLP)

A machine learning project that classifies news articles as "Real" or "Fake" using natural language processing.

-> Overview
This project analyzes text data from online news sources to detect misinformation. It demonstrates text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using popular NLP libraries.

-> Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK 
- Streamlit (for deployment)

-> Features
- Cleans and vectorizes text using TF-IDF
- Trains multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Displays prediction confidence
- Interactive Streamlit app for testing news headlines

-> Results
Achieved **~93% accuracy** on the test dataset. Deployed locally using Streamlit for live demos.

-> What I Learned
Improved understanding of data preprocessing, text vectorization, and model evaluation metrics.
